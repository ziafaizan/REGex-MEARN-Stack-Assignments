        <h1>Patrick Young</h1>
        <p>I am a lecturer in Standford Science Department. Before coming to Standford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams products throughout an entire software lifecycle--from initial product conception through the actual product launch.</p> 
        <p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process suport for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.</p>
