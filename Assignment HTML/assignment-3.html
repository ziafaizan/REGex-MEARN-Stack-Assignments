                Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer 
                grass that tickles your feet or the bed Bordeaux smacking on 
                your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries 
                special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can 
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
                are from where they travelled and what happened to them 
                along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex 
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new 
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

                is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement --- but life in the Stanford 
                dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's 
                Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too:
                the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fashion.
